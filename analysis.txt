Critic:
  - The database connection and the CurrencyConverter should be decoupeled, in
    the best case using a database abstraction layer.
  - The error handling is only based on 'die' statements. One should better use
    Exceptions. Also the logging is done to the browser-window in HTML, should
    be better done using a log framework in a log file.
  - The XML is not checked for well-formedness. If for example the same currency
    occurs twice, a SQL-Error will get thrown (due to duplicate primary key).
